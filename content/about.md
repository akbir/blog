Hi, I'm Akbir! I'm a researcher who cares about operationalising artificial intelligence to benefit people's lives. I'm obsessed with machine learning and its various subdomains including safety, robustness and social learning.  I blog here to discuss any ideas that take my interest, and as a means to help solidify my opinion (e.g. a form of Feynman test).

I'm currently, a Senior Researcher at [Tractable](https://tractable.ai), where I develop multi-modal models to evaluate in the wild data - e.g. partially damaged vehicles. Prior to this, I was Chief Research Officer at [Spherical Defence](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/spherical-defence-labs#section-overview),a London based start-up, which uses language models to create network-level intrusion detection systems.

I received an MPhil in Advanced Computer Science from the University of Cambridge, advised by [Hatice Gunes](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~hg410/). Before that, I was a MSci in Mathematics and Physics at UCL, where I worked in the [LCN](https://www.london-nano.com/) with [Steve Bramwell](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=STBRA27).

If you care about the same things, feel free to drop me an email.
